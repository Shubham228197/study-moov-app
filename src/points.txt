When we have to add hover in Button it eill only work wehn Hover is inline Declaired of a Button MUI Comp, but when we Do the same with Styled Mui Button and Hover does not work in Styled as well as in Inline SX={{}} of Styled.

we can do the hover in syles with these syntax: 
const Wrapper = styled.div`

    display: none;
  }
`

<Wrapper>
  <Button className="my__unique__button__class-asdf123" />
</Wrapper>
